# Introduction
Two options I could find was using either pyarrow or fastparquet. 
# Options
## pyarrow
As name suggests, pyarrow is a python library which supports managing Arrow memory format. Since both Arrow and Parquet came from same authors probably even parquet 
management can be done via pyarrow. 
## fastparquet
This is a Parquest specific library
